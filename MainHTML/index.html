                <p class="sml-txt med-font">There are many types of education. Formal education happens in a complex
                    institutional framework, like public schools. Non-formal education is also structured but happens
                    outside the formal schooling system. Informal education is unstructured learning through daily
                    experiences. Formal and non-formal education are divided into levels. They include early childhood
                    education, primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education</p>

                <p class="sml-txt med-font">The main field investigating education is called education studies. It
                    examines what
                    education is and what aims it has. It also studies how it happens, what effects it has, and how to
                    improve it. It has many subfields, like philosophy of education, psychology of education, sociology
                    of education, economics of education, and comparative education. It also discusses the history of
                    education. In prehistory, education happened informally through oral communication and imitation.
                    With the rise of ancient civilizations, writing was invented, and the amount of knowledge grew. This
                    caused a shift from informal to formal education. Initially, formal education was mainly available
                    to elites and religious groups.</p>

                <p class="sml-txt med-font">Secondary education is the stage of education following primary education.
                    It usually
                    covers the ages of 12 to 18 years. It is commonly divided into lower secondary education (middle
                    school or junior high school) and upper secondary education (high school, senior high school, or
                    college depending on the country). Lower secondary education normally has the completion of primary
                    school as its entry requirement. It aims to extend and deepen the learning outcomes. It is more
                    strongly focused on subject-specific curricula and teachers are specialized in only one or a few
                    specific subjects. One of its aims is to familiarize students with the basic theoretical concepts in
                    these fields. This helps create a solid basis for lifelong learning. In some cases, it also includes
                    vocational training.In many countries, it is the last stage of compulsory
                    education.
